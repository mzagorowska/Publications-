Introduction:
- The files are designed to be used separately, the necessary functions and packages are repeated in all of them
- It is necessary to comment/uncomment desired lines to obtain plots for responses or control inputs
- If plots are not visible after running a script, run plot!() in REPL

2. envECC/Manifest.toml <- (optional) ideally don't touch

To reproduce the results from the paper, use:

For obtaining derivatives wrt parameters in the synthetic case study
Folder: parametersderivatives_validation
1. DerivativesAlpha_Validation.jl <- to compute derivatives (two ways) wrt alpha
2. DerivativesG_Validation.jl <- to compute derivatives (two ways) wrt G
3. Derivativesu0_Validation.jl <- to compute derivatives (two ways) wrt u0

For obtaining derivatives wrt mismatch for the gas lift case study
Folder: gaslift_mismatch
1. CharacteristicsPlots.jl <- to plot the characteristics of the five wells
2. OFO_GasLift_Derivatives.jl <- to run the case studies for unconstrained and constrained cases
3. OFO_GasLift_ValidationMismatch.jl <- to run the case with no derivatives for no mismatch and mismatch due to constant gradients
